                 <h3>Hello there!</h3>
                    <p>
                    We are the team of Breakfree. A bunch of design students who have joined all of our individual skills to create this fun game for you. More than just class-mates, we are friends. This made working together fun and exciting. Here is a little something about our experience while working on this projectâ€¦</p>
                    <p>(In the image, from left to right, Akanksha, Prajna, Hasika and Shreya)</p>

                    <div style="float: left;">

                         <h3>Prajna Raghuveer</h3>
                           <p>Prototyping is an important tool which allows us as designers to gather feedback from our users. The process of prototyping gave our team the opportunity to bring our ideas to life from a single concept sketch and helped in testing its practicality and potential prospects. The entire process of prototyping over the days showed me how different people could get their assets to the table and work together to create something special with great team effort and communication. This project was an amazing experience for me and  made me realise my strongpoints as a designer and gave me opportunities to improve my skillsets. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div style="float: right;">
                         <h3>Akanksha Mahanti</h3>
                         <p>The journey of each product designed follows a number of steps to reach its target audience and prototyping is one significant phase. It represents a strong visualisation of the idea and allows multiple iterations before the final product is delivered to the mass. This project allowed me building the idea by optimising the resources in hand and working in a particular time span. A common theme throughout the week was rapid building and getting feedback at every stage. Overall, this project helped me understand the gap between ideation and final delivery of the product which would further help me in the subsequent projects.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div style="float: left;">
                         <h3>Hasika Tejwani</h3>
                         <p>As a designer, it is essential to not only be  innovative in ideation but also in prototyping. This project provided me with the opportunity to bring our idea to life, test the practicability of the current design and iterate based on the possibilities. It has given me hands on practice and increased my knowledge about mechanisms and technicalities that goes behind the aesthetic look of the products.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div style="float: right;">
                         <h3>Shreya Saraf</h3>
                         <p>Prototyping is a skill that needs to be mastered if you are in the design field. With the help of this awesome team I worked with, this task was really fun to do. It was a smooth amalgamation of all our skills which helped in the creation of the final product. The whole process was extremely methodic and each of us were involved in our own specific tasks. This 6-day journey helped me understand my capabilities as a designer and learn new skills which will be useful for me in future projects.</p>
